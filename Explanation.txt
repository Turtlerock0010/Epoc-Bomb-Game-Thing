epoc bomb game is a game made by me Turtlerock0010 in scratch.
There were multiple versions of this steming with various levels
of success.
The most common issue of the versions is the inability to solve making
functioning clones that act independently from each other. This problem
could have been solved by earlier me if i knew OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
to define the clones but i refused to learn.
anyways this corrects the mistakes and I hope to fully recreate the game
in python using pygame.
